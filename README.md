A simple script for QBCore & ESX to show your vehicle's mileage in-game. When driving a vehicle that is owned (stored in the database), you will see an odometer in the bottom right of your screen. You can configure it to use miles or kilometers.

## Installation

1. Download the zip, and move into your resources folder
2. Ensure the script in your server.cfg, by adding `ensure jg-vehiclemileage`. Make sure the script is ensured *after* your `qb-core` or `es_extended` resource
3. Run either the QBCore or ESX line of SQL in `run.sql` within your database
